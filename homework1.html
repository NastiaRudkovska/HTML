<h2> Vanity Fair: What was your first impression of Diana when you met? How did you decide you wanted to work with
    her? </h2>
<p><i> Stewart Pearce </i> : She was right in my face, this beautiful, beautiful being, these extraordinary eyes. I
    mean, she was extraordinary and I said, “Well I’m a bit on the spot, but I feel that the way that I can serve you
    best is if our relationship is completely confidential.” She was still surrounded by a circus, and she was just
    getting out of it. She had just done the Martin Bashir interview, and when she saw herself on screen and didn’t
    really like what she saw, she knew she could do better. That was the premise, but because I work very holistically,
    we got stuck to one another for two years. </p>
