<p class="xxx"><i> Diana's death </i> : On Sunday, Aug 31, 1997, Diana, the Princess of Wales, died following a car crash in Paris. There was widespread public mourning at the death of this popular figure, culminating with her funeral at Westminster Abbey, on Sat, Sept 6, 1997. </p>
<p class="yyy"><i> Diana's childhood and teenage years </i> : Diana, Princess of Wales, formerly Lady Diana Frances Spencer, was born on Jul 1, 1961 at Park House near Sandringham, Norfolk. She was the youngest daughter of the then Viscount and Viscountess Althorp, now the late (8th) Earl Spencer and the late Hon. Mrs Shand-Kydd, daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy. Until her father inherited the Earldom, she was styled The Honourable Diana Spencer. </p>
<p class="xxx"><i> Marriage and family </i> On 24 Feb, 1981, it was officially announced that Lady Diana was to marry The Prince of Wales. As neighbours at Sandringham until 1975, their families had known each other for many years, and Lady Diana and The Prince had met again when he was invited to a weekend at Althorp in November 1977. </p>
